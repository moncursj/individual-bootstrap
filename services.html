        <h2>Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures</h2>
        <p>Dominion is active in providing a full range of merger and acquisition advisory services. We have represented business owners in the sale of their companies, handled divestitures, conducted acquisition searches that resulted in completed transactions, assisted companies in valuing, negotiating and financing acquisitions and provided similar services to management teams in management buy-out transactions.</p>
            <i><h3 style="font-family:Bookman Old Style">Sale of Business</h3></i>
            <p>Dominion has been active in working with business owners in the sale of their companies and corporations in divesting divisions and subsidiaries. We communicate openly and honestly with clients throughout the course of an engagement, outlining appropriate valuation expectations, preparing a confidential memorandum, identifying purchaser candidates, handling all sale discussions and negotiations, and reviewing documentation. Our professionals are seasoned and have repeatedly demonstrated the capability to deal successfully with changing circumstances and unexpected challenges in maximizing value for our clients.</p>
            <i><h3 style="font-family:Bookman Old Style">Acquisition Advisory Services</h3></i>
            <p>Dominion has conducted extensive acquisition search assignments, provided valuation and structuring assistance for targeted engagements, and arranged for purchaser financing. Sample engagements include a large company requiring valuation assistance in a competitive purchase environment, a regional business acquiring a foreign supplier where valuation, negotiation and financing assistance were required, and a majority owner of a domestic manufacturer requiring valuation and financing assistance to purchase a minority partner’s interest. We tailor each assignment to provide the scope of services required by the client.</p>
            <i><h3 style="font-family:Bookman Old Style">Management Buy-Outs</h3></i>
            <p>Dominion has been active in working with management teams to help them purchase businesses that they manage. We have provided advisory and financing assistance to teams buying companies from financial owners and from corporate parents. The full range of our capability is often required in these assignments, including valuation, structuring, negotiation, and financing.</p>

        <h2>Capital Raising</h2>
        <p>Dominion has broad knowledge of the capital markets and strong relationships with a full spectrum of institutional investors. We work with clients to determine an optimal capital structure for a specific undertaking and then structure and arrange for the financing. The firm developed and maintains a proprietary database of thousands of investors across all classes of capital. We have successfully and repeatedly completed challenging assignments where time has been critical.</p>
            <i><h3 style="font-family:Bookman Old Style">Private Equity</h3></i>
            <p>Dominion maintains relationships with a broad array of private equity sponsors seeking to invest capital in middle market companies. Many private equity sources focus on change of control transactions including management buyouts, while others focus on growth opportunities, industry consolidation plays, or turnarounds. Our knowledge of these sources enables us to attract the most advantageous equity partner(s) possible.</p>
            <i><h3 style="font-family:Bookman Old Style">Senior Debt</h3></i>
            <p>Dominion works with institutions across lending disciplines. We have relationships with bank and non-bank lenders in providing secured credit and have completed transactions for companies requiring asset-based lending, cash flow-based lending, and a combination of each. Our firm has assisted companies in distressed situations and others that have had unique industry requirements. Dominion has worked on debt financings as part of a change in ownership of a business, an acquisition, a recapitalization and to supply growth capital. We work to design and implement the most advantageous structure while placing the financing with a lender who can best meet our client’s needs.</p>
            <i><h3 style="font-family:Bookman Old Style">Mezzanine</h3></i>
            <p>In many instances capital is required for an acquisition or internal growth that does not fit traditional senior debt lending parameters, but does not require pure equity. This kind of financing, known as mezzanine, is typically structured as subordinated debt or preferred stock. We have extensive relationships with institutions that provide this form of capital and have completed transactions both as part of an acquisition and as recapitalizations.</p>
